## Introduction

This 3.5 hour workshop is intended to provide an overview and hands-on
experience in deploying a full stack web mapping application using open source
geospatial technologies including GeoServer, PostGIS and OpenLayers.

By the end of the workshop the aim is to have a fully functional web app that
allows you to interactively explore a set of ABS statistics across Victoria.
